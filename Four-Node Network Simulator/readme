Simulate a four node point to point network withthe links connected as follows: n0 - n2, n1 - n2 and n2 - n3. Apply TCP agent between n0 - n3 and UDP agent between n1 - n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP, number of packets dropped, delay, throughput, packet delivery ratio using AWK script and generate a graph using GNUPLOT.
