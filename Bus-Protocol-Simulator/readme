To create scenario and study the performance of token bus protocol through simulation.

Algorithm to implement:
1. Create a simulator object
2. Define different colors for different data flows
3. Open a nam trace file and define finish procedure then close the trace file,and execute nam on trace file.
4. Create five nodes that forms a network numbered from 0 to 4
5. Create duplex links between the nodes and add Orientation to the nodes for setting a LAN topology
6. Setup TCP Connection between n(1) and n(3)
7. Apply CBR Traffic over TCP.
8. Schedule events and run the program.
